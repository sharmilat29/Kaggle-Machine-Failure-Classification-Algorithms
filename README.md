# Machine Failure Prediction : Model Playground

This project implements a several classification algorithms in Python using the Machine Failure dataset on Kaggle. 

Algorithms implemented:
1. Logistic Regression (with and without cross-validation)
2. Decision Tree Classifier
3. Random Forest Classifier
4. XGBoost Classifier
5. CatBoost Classifier
6. Neural Network Classification (work in progress)
